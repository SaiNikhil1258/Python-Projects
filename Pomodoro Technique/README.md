#Pomodoro Timer Application
##Overview
This is a simple Pomodoro timer application built using Python and the tkinter library. It helps users manage their work and break intervals to improve productivity. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface with a countdown timer and session tracking.

##Features
Start and stop the timer.
Reset the timer.
Keep track of work and break sessions.
Display checkmarks for completed work sessions.
Customizable work and break session durations.

##Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have Python installed on your system. The code also uses the tkinter library, which is typically included with standard Python installations.

Copy code
python main.py


##Usage
Upon running the application, you will see a window displaying the timer and control buttons.
Click the "Start" button to begin a Pomodoro session. The timer will count down the work session duration (default is 25 minutes).
After the work session, you'll hear an alert, and the timer will switch to a short break session (default is 5 minutes).
You can reset the timer at any time using the "Reset" button.
Completed work sessions are tracked with checkmarks below the timer.
After every 4 work sessions, a long break session (default is 20 minutes) is initiated.


##Customization
You can customize the work and break session durations by editing the constants at the beginning of the pomodoro.py file:
WORK_MIN: Duration of a work session in minutes (default is 25 minutes).
SHORT_BREAK_MIN: Duration of a short break in minutes (default is 5 minutes).
LONG_BREAK_MIN: Duration of a long break in minutes (default is 20 minutes).
