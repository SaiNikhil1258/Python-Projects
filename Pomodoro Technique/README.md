# Pomodoro Technique Timer

## Overview
This Python application implements a Pomodoro Technique timer, a time management method that breaks work into intervals (usually 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. This technique can help improve productivity and focus.

The Pomodoro Technique Timer provides a simple command-line interface for managing your work and break sessions. It is easy to use and highly customizable.

## Features
- Set custom work and break durations.
- Track completed sessions.
- View session statistics.

## Customization
You can customize the following parameters in the `pomodoro.py` file:
- `WORK_DURATION`: Duration of the work session in seconds (default is 1500 seconds, i.e., 25 minutes).
- `BREAK_DURATION`: Duration of the break session in seconds (default is 300 seconds, i.e., 5 minutes).
- `LONG_BREAK_DURATION`: Duration of the long break session in seconds (default is 1800 seconds, i.e., 30 minutes).
- `SESSIONS_BEFORE_LONG_BREAK`: Number of work sessions before a long break (default is 4).
