# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Timer is a simple and effective productivity tool designed to help you manage your work and break intervals, following the well-known Pomodoro Technique. With this app, you can boost your productivity and maintain focus by breaking your work into manageable intervals, enhancing your efficiency and reducing burnout.

## How it Works

The Pomodoro Timer operates with the following cycle:

1. **Work Interval**: Start the timer to begin your work session, which lasts for 25 minutes by default. During this time, you can fully concentrate on your tasks.

2. **Break Interval**: After the work interval, a beep sound will alert you, signaling that it's time for a short break. These breaks are set to 5 minutes by default and serve as a moment to relax and recharge.

3. **Cycle Completion**: The timer will automatically repeat the work and break intervals for a total of four cycles. After completing four work intervals, you will be rewarded with a longer break of 20 minutes. This extended break allows you to unwind and prepare for the next productive session.

## Features

- **Timer Reset**: If at any point you need to reset the timer, simply click the "Reset" button to start a new cycle.

## Customizations:
1. **WORK_MIN**:Change the WORK_MIN variable to as per your requirements.
2. **SHORT_BREAK_MIN**:Change the SHORT_BREAK_MIN variable to as per your requirments.
3. **LONG_BREAK_MIN**:Change the LONG_BREAK-MIN variable to as per you requirements.
